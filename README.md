# Stock Portfolio Analyzer

This Python script allows you to analyze the value of your stock portfolio and visualize it through a pie chart. It utilizes the `yfinance` library to fetch real-time stock data and `plotly` for creating interactive charts.

## Instructions:

1. Run the script.
2. Input the number of stocks in your portfolio.
3. Enter each stock symbol and the number of shares you own.
4. The script will display the current value of each stock and the total value of your portfolio.
5. After entering all stocks, a pie chart will be generated to visualize the distribution of your portfolio.

## Prerequisites:

- [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/)
- [plotly](https://pypi.org/project/plotly/)

## Usage:

```bash
pip install yfinance
pip install plotly
```

## Note:

Make sure to have an active internet connection to fetch real-time stock data.
The pie chart is created using plotly, and it will be displayed in your default web browser.
